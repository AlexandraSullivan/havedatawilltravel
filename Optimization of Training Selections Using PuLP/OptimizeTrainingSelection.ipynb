    "The optimal solution from our model was used to place people to workshops optimizing their preference level. Since there are over seven students per course, we can see that all of the students are assigned to their top choice amoung the selected options. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should acknowledge that we have used simpler methods to determine which courses to hold. For example, we could have asked people to vote for their top choice only to determine which three workshops to hold before assigning students. This is equivalent to counting the number of times each workshop was assigned a rank of one. In our data, this would lead to picking Sim and Viz, but then there would be a three-way-tie for the last pick between R Stats, API's, and NLP. Python actually has the least number of people indicating it as their top choice, but several people indicating it as their second choice in the final solution. Using optimization, we can see a solution that meets our needs that might not have been obvious otherwise. Plus, this way gave us a reason to learn more about Python, PuLP, and optimization!"
